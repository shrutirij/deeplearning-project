The/DT term/NN ``/`` margin/NN ''/'' has/VBZ slightly/RB different/JJ meanings/NNS in/IN the/DT stock/NN and/CC futures/NNS markets/NNS ,/, but/CC they/PRP  both/DT describe/VBP the/DT amount/NN of/IN cash/NN investors/NNS must/MD put/VB up/RP to/TO get/VB into/IN the/DT game/NN ./.

the/DT markets/NNS linked/VBN so/RB closely/RB through/IN arbitrage/NN ,/, speculation/NN in/IN futures/NNS is/VBZ translated/VBN quickly/RB into/IN stocks/NNS ./.
stock-index/JJ futures/NNS margins/NNS could/MD make/VB the/DT stock/NN market/NN even/RB more/RBR volatile/JJ ,/, futures/NNS traders/NNS ./.

these/DT speculators/NNS ca/MD n't/RB afford/VB to/TO trade/NN as/RB actively/RB as/IN before/RB ,/, stock-index/JJ futures/NNS prices/NNS ,/, and/CC therefore/RB stock/NN prices/NNS ,/, may/MD have/VB to/TO fall/VB further/RBR than/IN they/PRP might/MD otherwise/RB to/TO attract/VB buyers/NNS ./.

stock-index/JJ futures/NNS margins/NNS sharply/RB could/MD curtail/VB the/DT volume/NN of/IN index/NN arbitrage/NN trading/NN by/IN the/DT handful/NN of/IN Wall/NNP Street/NNP securities/NNS firms/NNS  that/WDT dominate/VBP the/DT business/NN ./.
