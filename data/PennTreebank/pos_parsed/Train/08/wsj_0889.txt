The/DT Treasury/NNP 's/POS action/NN comes/VBZ in/IN response/NN to/TO a/DT continuing/JJ stalemate/NN on/IN Capitol/NNP Hill/NNP over/IN the/DT debt-limit/NN legislation/NN ./.
Democrats/NNPS want/VBP to/TO use/VB the/DT debt-limit/NN bill/NN as/IN a/DT vehicle/NN for/IN enacting/VBG unrelated/JJ legislation/NN that/IN the/DT administration/NN opposes/VBZ ,/, and/CC the/DT administration/NN is/VBZ considering/VBG using/VBG the/DT bill/NN as/IN a/DT vehicle/NN for/IN a/DT cut/NN in/IN the/DT capital-gains/NNS tax/NN ./.
recent/JJ days/NNS ,/, the/DT battle/NN has/VBZ become/VBN a/DT game/NN of/IN chicken/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP had/VBD raised/VBN the/DT prospect/NN that/IN the/DT government/NN might/MD run/VB out/RP of/IN cash/NN next/IN Friday/NNP and/CC be/VB unable/JJ to/TO mail/VB Social/NNP Security/NNP checks/NNS ./.
Treasury/NNP officials/NNS said/VBD they/PRP decided/VBD to/TO take/VB their/PRP$ extraordinary/JJ action/NN to/TO make/VB certain/JJ that/IN Social/NNP Security/NNP recipients/NNS get/VB their/PRP$ checks/NNS ./.
They/PRP also/RB said/VBD the/DT administration/NN may/MD still/RB seek/VB to/TO attach/VB a/DT capital-gains/NNS tax/NN cut/VBN to/TO the/DT debt/NN legislation/NN despite/IN the/DT intensifying/JJ controversy/NN ./.
The/DT secretary/NN believes/VBZ capital/NN gains/NNS is/VBZ a/DT top/JJ priority/NN and/CC that/IN any/DT available/JJ vehicle/NN ought/MD to/TO be/VB used/VBN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Assistant/NNP Treasury/NNP Secretary/NNP Roger/NNP Bolton/NNP ./.
debt-limit/NN legislation/NN allows/VBZ the/DT Treasury/NNP to/TO borrow/VB as/RB much/JJ as/IN $/$ 2.87/CD trillion/CD ./.
the/DT government/NN 's/POS debt/NN totals/VBZ only/RB $/$ 2.853/CD trillion/CD ./.
That/DT means/VBZ the/DT government/NN can/MD legally/RB sell/VB another/DT $/$ 17/CD billion/CD in/IN debt/NN ,/, provided/VBN it/PRP acts/NNS by/IN Tuesday/NNP ./.
Tuesday/NNP ,/, the/DT debt/NN limit/NN expires/VBZ ,/, and/CC the/DT limit/NN drops/VBZ back/RB to/TO $/$ 2.8/CD trillion/CD ./.
that/DT occurs/VBZ ,/, no/DT new/JJ securities/NNS can/MD be/VB issued/VBN without/IN violating/VBG the/DT debt-limit/NN law/NN ./.

his/PRP$ letter/NN to/TO congressional/JJ leaders/NNS ,/, Treasury/NNP Secretary/NNP Brady/NNP called/VBD the/DT move/NN  an/DT ``/`` extraordinary/JJ administrative/JJ action/NN ./.

Mr./NNP Brady/NNP also/RB said/VBD that/IN he/PRP is/VBZ ``/`` aware/JJ of/IN no/DT other/JJ realistic/JJ measures/NNS ,/, other/JJ than/IN debt-limit/NN legislation/NN ,/, that/WDT could/MD further/RB extend/VB the/DT anticipated/JJ date/NN of/IN default/NN ./.
The/DT debt-limit/NN debate/NN has/VBZ become/VBN an/DT annual/JJ ritual/NN between/IN the/DT administration/NN and/CC Congress/NNP ./.
the/DT limit/NN is/VBZ necessary/JJ to/TO keep/VB the/DT U.S./NNP from/IN defaulting/VBG on/IN its/PRP$ obligations/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT increase/NN always/RB creates/VBZ intense/JJ controversy/NN in/IN Congress/NNP ./.
Legislators/NNS like/VBP to/TO amend/VB the/DT debt-limit/NN bill/NN with/IN extraneous/JJ legislation/NN because/IN they/PRP believe/VBP it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT difficult/JJ bill/NN for/IN the/DT president/NN to/TO veto/NN ./.
This/DT year/NN ,/, the/DT debt-limit/NN debate/NN promises/VBZ to/TO be/VB particularly/RB intense/JJ because/RB of/IN the/DT battle/NN over/IN capital/NN gains/NNS ./.
The/DT administration/NN and/CC its/PRP$ Republican/JJ allies/NNS see/VBP the/DT measure/NN as/IN a/DT possible/JJ opportunity/NN to/TO pass/VB a/DT capital-gains/NNS tax/NN cut/NN ./.
Their/PRP$ hope/NN is/VBZ that/IN Democratic/JJ leaders/NNS in/IN the/DT Senate/NNP would/MD n't/RB block/VB it/PRP for/IN fear/NN of/IN being/VBG blamed/VBN for/IN the/DT government/NN 's/POS default/NN ./.
