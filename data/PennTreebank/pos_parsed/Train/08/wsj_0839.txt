Mr./NNP Guber/NNP and/CC Mr./NNP Peters/NNP are/VBP currently/RB under/IN contract/NN to/TO produce/VB movies/NNS exclusively/RB for/IN Warner/NNP ./.

Sony/NNP claims/VBZ an/DT injunction/NN would/MD leave/VB it/PRP ``/`` faced/VBN with/IN the/DT ominous/JJ possibility/NN that/IN it/PRP would/MD complete/VB a/DT $/$ 5/CD billion/CD entertainment/NN company/NN acquisition/NN and/CC be/VB left/VBN with/IN no/DT management/NN to/TO run/VB the/DT company/NN ./.
Sony/NNP adds/VBZ that/IN ``/`` Warner/NNP must/MD be/VB grinning/VBG from/IN ear/NN to/TO ear/NN at/IN the/DT possibility/NN of/IN leaving/VBG Sony/NNP in/IN such/PDT a/DT position/NN and/CC at/IN the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO prevent/VB the/DT revitalization/NN of/IN Columbia/NNP into/IN a/DT strong/JJ competitor/NN ./.
Sony/NNP disputes/VBZ Warner/NNP 's/POS contention/NN that/IN its/PRP$ offer/NN to/TO Mr./NNP Guber/NNP and/CC Mr./NNP Peters/NNP violates/VBZ their/PRP$ contract/NN with/IN Warner/NNP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ in/IN the/DT process/NN of/IN being/VBG acquired/VBN by/IN New/NNP York-based/JJ Time/NNP Warner/NNP Inc/NNP ./.
Sony/NNP claims/VBZ that/IN the/DT contract/NN as/IN written/VBN --/: and/CC oral/JJ agreements/NNS that/IN Warner/NNP has/VBZ denied/VBN exist/VB --/: allow/VB the/DT producers/NNS to/TO take/VB on/RP such/JJ executive/NN posts/NNS ./.
Sony/NNP 's/POS legal/JJ argument/NN even/RB raises/VBZ the/DT novel/JJ idea/NN that/IN Mr./NNP Guber/NNP and/CC Mr./NNP Peters/NNP could/MD actually/RB make/VB movies/NNS for/IN Warner/NNP while/IN serving/VBG in/IN executive/JJ posts/NNS at/IN another/DT studio/NN ./.

Sony/NNP says/VBZ ,/, that/IN does/VBZ n't/RB exclude/VB them/PRP from/IN taking/VBG an/DT executive/JJ post/NN at/IN another/DT company/NN where/WRB they/PRP would/MD be/VB involved/VBN in/IN choosing/VBG movies/NNS and/CC in/IN managing/VBG ,/, but/CC not/RB in/IN day-to-day/JJ production/NN of/IN movies/NNS ./.

the/DT arguments/NNS Sony/NNP makes/VBZ is/VBZ that/IN Warner/NNP should/MD let/VB the/DT producers/NNS go/VB to/TO Columbia/NNP because/IN it/PRP already/RB allowed/VBD the/DT producers/NNS to/TO become/VB co-chairmen/NNS of/IN publicly/RB held/VBN Barris/NNP Industries/NNP Inc./NNP ,/, which/WDT earlier/RB this/DT year/NN changed/VBD its/PRP$ name/NN to/TO Guber/NNP Peters/NNP Entertainment/NNP ./.
