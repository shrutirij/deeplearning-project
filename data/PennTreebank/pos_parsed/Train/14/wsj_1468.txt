Ekco/NNP Group/NNP Inc./NNP ,/, Nashua/NNP ,/, N.H./NNP ,/, expects/VBZ to/TO report/VB that/DT net/JJ income/NN in/IN the/DT third/JJ quarter/NN ,/, ended/VBN Oct./NNP 1/CD ,/, fell/VBD 50/CD %/NN to/TO 60/CD %/NN from/IN $/$ 2.1/CD million/CD ,/, or/CC 11/CD cents/NNS  a/DT share/NN ,/, a/DT year/NN ./.
Robert/NNP Stein/NNP ,/, president/NN and/CC chief/JJ executive/NN officer/NN ,/, attributed/VBD the/DT expected/JJ decline/NN partly/RB to/TO the/DT effects/NNS of/IN a/DT two-week/JJ strike/NN last/JJ month/NN at/IN the/DT company/NN 's/POS Masillon/NNP ,/, Ohio/NNP ,/, bakeware/NN facility/NN ./.
Softer-than-expected/JJ orders/NNS in/IN early/JJ September/NNP also/RB played/VBD a/DT role/NN ,/, he/PRP said/VBD in/IN an/DT interview/NN ./.
Mr./NNP Stein/NNP said/VBD he/PRP is/VBZ ``/`` reasonably/RB confident/JJ ''/'' that/IN earnings/NNS for/IN the/DT full/JJ year/NN will/MD exceed/VB the/DT $/$ 3.1/CD million/CD ,/, or/CC 17/CD cents/NNS  a/DT share/NN ,/, in/IN 1988/CD ./.
That/DT would/MD require/VB fourth-quarter/JJ net/NN of/IN more/JJR than/IN about/IN 22/CD cents/NNS to/TO 24/CD cents/NNS  a/DT share/NN ,/, assuming/VBG that/IN Mr./NNP Stein/NNP 's/POS third-quarter/JJ estimate/NN proves/VBZ accurate/JJ ./.
the/DT year-earlier/JJ fourth/JJ quarter/NN ,/, the/DT company/NN had/VBD profit/NN of/IN $/$ 2.7/CD million/CD ,/, or/CC 15/CD cents/NNS  a/DT share/NN ./.

The/DT year-earlier/JJ periods/NNS do/VBP n't/RB reflect/VB results/NNS of/IN the/DT company/NN 's/POS Woodstream/NNP Corp./NNP unit/NN ,/, acquired/VBN last/JJ January/NNP ,/, but/CC include/VBP some/DT Canadian/JJ operations/NNS   that/WDT were/VBD sold/VBN at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN 1988/CD ./.
August/NNP through/IN October/NNP traditionally/RB is/VBZ the/DT busiest/JJS season/NN for/IN the/DT bakeware/NN business/NN ,/, as/IN many/JJ retailers/NNS use/VBP the/DT goods/NNS as/IN autumn/NN promotional/JJ items/NNS ./.
Mr./NNP Stein/NNP said/VBD some/DT retailers/NNS --/: perhaps/RB anxious/JJ about/IN minimizing/VBG inventories/NNS --/: appear/VBP to/TO have/VB held/VBN back/RB on/IN orders/NNS in/IN September/NNP but/CC have/VBP been/VBN ordering/VBG more/RBR heavily/RB in/IN October/NNP ./.

Mr./NNP Stein/NNP said/VBD he/PRP expects/VBZ profit/NN to/TO be/VB higher/JJR in/IN 1990/CD than/IN in/IN 1989/CD ,/, reflecting/VBG a/DT number/NN of/IN measures/NNS taken/VBN since/IN the/DT acquisition/NN of/IN Ekco/NNP Housewares/NNPS in/IN late/JJ 1987/CD ./.
the/DT housewares/NNS business/NN ,/, the/DT company/NN was/VBD known/VBN as/IN Centronics/NNP Corp./NNP ;/: Centronics/NNP had/VBD been/VBN a/DT maker/NN of/IN computer/NN printers/NNS ,/, but/CC Mr./NNP Stein/NNP and/CC other/JJ officers/NNS decided/VBD to/TO sell/VB that/DT business/NN after/IN Japanese/JJ competitors/NNS grabbed/VBD a/DT dominant/JJ share/NN of/IN the/DT market/NN ./.
Mr./NNP Stein/NNP said/VBD tighter/JJR operating/NN controls/NNS have/VBP enabled/VBN Ekco/NNP to/TO reduce/VB inventory/NN levels/NNS 25/CD %/NN to/TO 30/CD %/NN ;/: improve/VB on-time/JJ delivery/NN of/IN orders/NNS to/TO about/IN 95/CD %/NN from/IN around/IN 70/CD %/NN ;/: and/CC to/TO lower/VB the/DT number/NN of/IN labor/NN hours/NNS required/VBN to/TO produce/VB a/DT unit/NN ./.
the/DT design/NN of/IN new/JJ products/NNS in-house/JJ --/: instead/RB of/IN contracting/VBG out/RP the/DT work/NN --/: the/DT company/NN also/RB has/VBZ been/VBN able/JJ to/TO come/VB up/RB with/IN designs/NNS  that/WDT can/MD be/VB manufactured/VBN more/RBR efficiently/RB ,/, he/PRP ./.

Ekco/NNP continues/VBZ to/TO seek/VB further/JJ acquisitions/NNS in/IN the/DT consumer-products/JJ industry/NN ,/, Mr./NNP Stein/NNP ./.
He/PRP indicated/VBD that/IN Ekco/NNP may/MD be/VB interested/JJ in/IN acquiring/VBG another/DT company/NN with/IN revenue/NN in/IN the/DT range/NN of/IN $/$ 75/CD million/CD to/TO $/$ 100/CD million/CD ,/, partly/RB because/IN mass/NN merchandisers/NNS increasingly/RB want/VBP to/TO rely/VB on/IN larger/JJR ,/, and/CC fewer/JJR ,/, suppliers/NNS ./.
