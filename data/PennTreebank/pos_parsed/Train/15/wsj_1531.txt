A/DT labor-management/JJ group/NN is/VBZ preparing/VBG a/DT revised/VBN buy-out/NN bid/NN for/IN United/NNP Airlines/NNP parent/NN UAL/NNP Corp./NNP  that/WDT would/MD transfer/VB majority/NN ownership/NN to/TO employees/NNS while/IN leaving/VBG some/DT stock/NN in/IN public/JJ hands/NNS ,/, according/VBG to/TO people/NNS familiar/JJ with/IN the/DT group/NN ./.
The/DT group/NN has/VBZ been/VBN discussing/VBG a/DT proposal/NN valued/VBN in/IN a/DT range/NN of/IN $/$ 225/CD to/TO $/$ 240/CD  a/DT share/NN ,/, or/CC $/$ 5.09/CD billion/CD to/TO $/$ 5.42/CD billion/CD ./.
the/DT risk/NN of/IN rejection/NN ,/, the/DT group/NN does/VBZ n't/RB plan/VB to/TO submit/VB the/DT plan/NN formally/RB at/IN a/DT UAL/NNP board/NN meeting/NN today/NN ./.
the/DT group/NN is/VBZ raising/VBG the/DT proposal/NN informally/RB to/TO try/VB to/TO test/VB the/DT board/NN 's/POS reaction/NN ./.
People/NNS familiar/JJ with/IN the/DT company/NN say/VBP the/DT board/NN is/VBZ n't/RB likely/JJ to/TO give/VB quick/JJ approval/NN to/TO any/DT offer/NN substantially/RB below/IN the/DT $/$ 300-a-share/JJ ,/, $/$ 6.79/CD billion/CD buy-out/NN bid/NN  that/WDT collapsed/VBD last/JJ week/NN after/IN banks/NNS would/MD n't/RB raise/VB needed/VBN loans/NNS and/CC after/IN a/DT key/JJ partner/NN ,/, British/NNP Airways/NNP PLC/NNP ./.

the/DT pilots/NNS union/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN pushing/VBG for/IN a/DT takeover/NN since/IN 1987/CD ,/, appears/VBZ to/TO be/VB pressing/VBG ahead/RB with/IN the/DT revised/VBN bid/NN to/TO avoid/VB further/JJ loss/NN of/IN momentum/NN even/RB though/IN it/PRP  has/VBZ n't/RB found/VBD a/DT partner/NN to/TO replace/VB British/NNP Air/NNP ./.
the/DT bidding/NN group/NN has/VBZ n't/RB had/VBD time/NN to/TO develop/VB its/PRP$ latest/JJS idea/NN fully/RB or/CC to/TO discuss/VB it/PRP with/IN banks/NNS ,/, it/PRP believes/VBZ bank/NN financing/NN ./.
the/DT collapse/NN of/IN the/DT last/JJ effort/NN ,/, the/DT group/NN does/VBZ n't/RB plan/VB to/TO make/VB any/DT formal/JJ proposal/NN without/IN binding/JJ commitments/NNS from/IN banks/NNS covering/VBG the/DT entire/JJ amount/NN ./.
the/DT type/NN of/IN transaction/NN being/VBG discussed/VBN ,/, the/DT pilot-management/JJ group/NN would/MD borrow/VB several/JJ billion/CD dollars/NNS from/IN banks/NNS  that/WDT could/MD then/RB be/VB used/VBN to/TO finance/VB a/DT cash/NN payment/NN to/TO current/JJ holders/NNS ./.
Those/DT current/JJ holders/NNS would/MD also/RB receive/VB minority/NN interests/NNS in/IN the/DT new/JJ company/NN ./.

UAL/NNP currently/RB has/VBZ 22.6/CD million/CD shares/NNS ./.
The/DT new/JJ structure/NN would/MD be/VB similar/JJ to/TO a/DT recapitalization/NN in/IN which/WDT holders/NNS get/VBP a/DT special/JJ dividend/NN yet/CC retain/VBP a/DT controlling/JJ ownership/NN interest/NN ./.
The/DT difference/NN is/VBZ that/IN current/JJ holders/NNS would/MD n't/RB retain/VB majority/NN ownership/NN or/CC control/NN ./.
The/DT failed/JJ takeover/NN would/MD have/VB given/VBN UAL/NNP employees/NNS 75/CD %/NN voting/NN control/NN of/IN the/DT nation/NN 's/POS second-largest/JJ airline/NN ,/, with/IN management/NN getting/VBG 10/CD %/NN control/NN and/CC British/NNP Air/NNP 15/CD %/NN ./.
It/PRP  was/VBD n't/RB clear/JJ how/WRB the/DT ownership/NN would/MD stack/VB up/RP under/IN the/DT new/JJ plan/NN ,/, but/CC employees/NNS would/MD keep/VB more/JJR than/IN 50/CD %/NN ./.
Management/NN 's/POS total/NN could/MD be/VB reduced/VBN ,/, and/CC the/DT public/NN could/MD get/VB more/JJR than/IN the/DT 15/CD %/NN control/NN  that/WDT had/VBD been/VBN earmarked/VBN for/IN British/NNP Air/NNP ./.
One/CD option/NN  the/DT board/NN is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO consider/VB today/NN is/VBZ some/DT sort/NN of/IN cooling-off/JJ period/NN ./.
the/DT pilots/NNS are/VBP expected/VBN to/TO continue/VB to/TO pursue/VB the/DT bid/NN ,/, UAL/NNP Chairman/NNP Stephen/NNP Wolf/NNP may/MD be/VB asked/VBN to/TO withdraw/VB from/IN the/DT buy-out/NN effort/NN ,/, at/IN least/JJS temporarily/RB ,/, and/CC to/TO return/VB to/TO running/VBG the/DT company/NN full/JJ time/NN ./.
The/DT board/NN could/MD eventually/RB come/VB under/IN some/DT pressure/NN to/TO sell/VB the/DT company/NN because/IN its/PRP$ members/NNS can/MD be/VB ousted/VBN by/IN a/DT majority/NN shareholder/NN vote/NN ,/, particularly/RB since/IN one-third/JJ of/IN UAL/NNP stock/NN is/VBZ held/VBN by/IN takeover/NN stock/NN speculators/NNS  who/WP favor/VBP a/DT sale/NN ./.
The/DT labor-management/JJ buy-out/NN group/NN plans/VBZ to/TO keep/VB its/PRP$ offer/NN on/IN the/DT table/NN in/IN an/DT apparent/JJ attempt/NN to/TO maintain/VB its/PRP$ bargaining/NN position/NN with/IN the/DT board/NN ./.
the/DT only/JJ outsider/NN  who/WP has/VBZ emerged/VBN to/TO lead/VB such/JJ a/DT shareholder/NN vote/NN ,/, Los/NNP Angeles/NNP investor/NN Marvin/NNP Davis/NNP ,/, who/WP triggered/VBD the/DT buy-out/NN with/IN a/DT $/$ 5.4/CD billion/CD bid/NN in/IN early/JJ August/NNP ,/, is/VBZ hanging/VBG back/RB --/: apparently/RB to/TO avoid/VB being/VBG blamed/VBN for/IN contributing/VBG to/TO the/DT deal/NN 's/POS collapse/NN ./.
Three/CD top/JJ advisers/NNS to/TO Mr./NNP Davis/NNP visited/VBD New/NNP York/NNP late/JJ last/JJ week/NN ,/, at/IN least/JJS in/IN part/NN to/TO confer/VB with/IN executives/NNS at/IN Citicorp/NNP ./.
Mr./NNP Davis/NNP had/VBD paid/VBN $/$ 6/CD million/CD for/IN Citicorp/NNP 's/POS backing/NN of/IN his/PRP$ last/JJ bid/NN ./.
Citicorp/NNP has/VBZ lost/VBN some/DT credibility/NN because/IN it/PRP also/RB led/VBD the/DT unsuccessful/JJ effort/NN to/TO gain/VB bank/NN loans/NNS for/IN the/DT labor-management/JJ group/NN ./.
Friday/NNP ,/, British/NNP Air/NNP issued/VBD a/DT statement/NN saying/VBG it/PRP ``/`` does/VBZ not/RB intend/VB to/TO participate/VB in/IN any/DT new/JJ deal/NN for/IN the/DT acquisition/NN of/IN UAL/NNP in/IN the/DT foreseeable/JJ future/NN ./.
several/JJ people/NNS said/VBD that/IN British/NNP Air/NNP might/MD yet/RB rejoin/VB the/DT bidding/NN group/NN and/CC that/IN the/DT carrier/NN made/VBD the/DT statement/NN to/TO answer/VB questions/NNS from/IN British/JJ regulators/NNS about/IN how/WRB it/PRP plans/VBZ to/TO use/VB proceeds/NNS of/IN a/DT securities/NNS offering/NN previously/RB earmarked/VBN for/IN the/DT UAL/NNP buy-out/NN ./.
last/JJ week/NN ,/, UAL/NNP flight/NN attendants/NNS agreed/VBD to/TO participate/VB with/IN the/DT pilots/NNS in/IN crafting/VBG a/DT revised/VBN offer/NN ./.
the/DT machinists/NNS union/NN ,/, whose/WP$ opposition/NN helped/VBD scuttle/VB the/DT first/JJ buy-out/NN bid/NN ,/, is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO favor/VB a/DT recapitalization/NN with/IN a/DT friendly/JJ third-party/JJ investor/NN ./.
One/CD advantage/NN  the/DT buy-out/NN group/NN intends/VBZ to/TO press/VB with/IN the/DT board/NN is/VBZ that/IN pilots/NNS have/VBP agreed/VBN to/TO make/VB $/$ 200/CD million/CD in/IN annual/JJ cost/NN concessions/NNS to/TO help/VB finance/VB a/DT bid/NN ./.
Speculation/NN has/VBZ also/RB arisen/VBN that/IN the/DT UAL/NNP executive/NN most/RBS closely/RB identified/VBN with/IN the/DT failure/NN to/TO gain/VB bank/NN financing/NN ,/, chief/JJ financial/JJ officer/NN John/NNP Pope/NNP ,/, may/MD come/VB under/IN pressure/NN ./.
people/NNS familiar/JJ with/IN the/DT buy-out/NN group/NN said/VBD Mr./NNP Pope/NNP 's/POS departure/NN would/MD weaken/VB the/DT airline/NN 's/POS management/NN at/IN a/DT critical/JJ time/NN ./.
the/DT buy-out/NN group/NN 's/POS failure/NN to/TO obtain/VB financing/NN ,/, UAL/NNP remains/VBZ obligated/JJ to/TO pay/VB $/$ 26.7/CD million/CD in/IN investment/NN banking/NN and/CC legal/JJ fees/NNS to/TO the/DT group/NN 's/POS advisers/NNS ,/, Lazard/NNP Freres/NNP &/CC Co./NNP ,/, Salomon/NNP Brothers/NNP Inc./NNP ,/, and/CC Paul/NNP Weiss/NNP Rifkind/NNP Wharton/NNP &/CC Garrison/NNP ./.
