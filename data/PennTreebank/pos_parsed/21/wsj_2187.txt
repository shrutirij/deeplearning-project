turmoil/NN created/VBN by/IN a/DT costly/JJ S&L/NN bailout/NN and/CC the/DT growing/VBG realization/NN that/IN a/DT government/NN guarantee/NN may/MD become/VB a/DT taxpayer/NN liability/NN ,/, some/DT members/NNS of/IN Congress/NNP are/VBP insistent/JJ on/IN using/VBG tax/NN dollars/NNS as/IN collateral/NN for/IN risky/JJ and/CC unnecessary/JJ government-backed/JJ deals/NNS ./.
This/DT appears/VBZ to/TO be/VB the/DT case/NN with/IN the/DT Federal/NNP Housing/NNP Administration/NNP 's/POS mortgage/NN guarantee/NN program/NN ./.
A/DT program/NN created/VBD to/TO assist/VB low/JJ -/: to/TO moderate-income/JJ people/NNS ,/, it/PRP may/MD soon/RB be/VB expanded/VBN to/TO accommodate/VB much/JJ higher/JJR loan/NN amounts/NNS for/IN well-to-do/JJ home/NN purchasers/NNS ./.
The/DT FHA/NNP now/RB holds/VBZ a/DT 50/CD %/NN share/NN of/IN the/DT mortgage/NN insurance/NN market/NN ,/, while/IN mismanagement/NN prevails/VBZ throughout/IN the/DT agency/NN ./.
The/DT General/NNP Accounting/NNP Office/NNP has/VBZ just/RB completed/VBN an/DT FHA/NNP financial/JJ audit/NN showing/VBG a/DT loss/NN of/IN $/$ 4.2/CD billion/CD for/IN fiscal/JJ 1988/CD ./.
Significant/JJ losses/NNS are/VBP also/RB expected/VBN for/IN the/DT fiscal/JJ year/NN just/RB ended/VBN ./.
Congress/NNP should/MD not/RB consider/VB any/DT expansion/NN of/IN FHA/NNP until/IN a/DT comprehensive/JJ ,/, proven/JJ plan/NN for/IN FHA/NNP solvency/NN and/CC reform/NN is/VBZ established/VBN ./.
Ignoring/VBG  the/DT FHA/NNP losses/NNS ,/, a/DT few/JJ of/IN my/PRP$ colleagues/NNS have/VBP pushed/VBN for/IN expansion/NN of/IN FHA/NNP mortgage/NN guarantees/NNS by/IN including/VBG wealthier/JJR home/NN purchasers/NNS in/IN the/DT program/NN ./.
The/DT National/NNP Affordable/NNP Housing/NNP Act/NNP (/( Cranston-D'Amato/NNP )/) ,/, introduced/VBN earlier/RB this/DT year/NN ,/, erases/VBZ the/DT current/JJ mortgage/NN guarantee/NN ceiling/NN of/IN $/$ 101,250/CD and/CC places/VBZ a/DT ``/`` floating/JJ cap/NN ''/'' at/IN 95/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT median/JJ home/NN price/NN in/IN higher-cost/JJR areas/NNS ./.
it/PRP increases/VBZ FHA/NNP loan-guarantee/NN amounts/NNS ,/, this/DT bill/NN also/RB calls/VBZ for/IN the/DT reduction/NN of/IN down-payment/NN requirements/NNS ./.
Legislation/NN of/IN this/DT nature/NN can/MD be/VB likened/VBN to/TO fueling/VBG a/DT runaway/JJ locomotive/NN headed/VBN in/IN the/DT wrong/JJ direction/NN ./.

Taxpayers/NNS will/MD be/VB saddled/VBN with/IN a/DT tremendous/JJ financial/JJ burden/NN if/IN these/DT fundamental/JJ data/NNS are/VBP not/RB heeded/VBN ./.
a/DT Senate/NNP Appropriations/NNPS bill/NN similarly/RB removed/VBD the/DT current/JJ FHA/NNP mortgage/NN guarantee/NN ceiling/NN and/CC increased/VBD it/PRP to/TO 95/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT median/JJ home/NN price/NN in/IN higher-cost/JJR areas/NNS ./.

concern/NN for/IN the/DT potentially/RB damaging/JJ effects/NNS of/IN this/DT proposal/NN ,/, and/CC still/RB awaiting/VBG the/DT GAO/NNP report/NN on/IN FHA/NNP losses/NNS ,/, I/PRP suggested/VBD the/DT Senate/NNP instead/RB work/VB on/IN ways/NNS to/TO eliminate/VB or/CC substantially/RB curtail/VB this/DT vast/JJ loan-guarantee/NN expansion/NN ./.
several/JJ hours/NNS of/IN floor/NN debate/NN and/CC three/CD roll-call/NN votes/NNS ,/, we/PRP reached/VBD a/DT compromise/NN ,/, placing/VBG the/DT FHA/NNP loan-guarantee/NN ceiling/NN at/IN $/$ 124,875/CD ./.
my/PRP$ desire/NN to/TO retain/VB the/DT present/JJ ceiling/NN was/VBD exceeded/VBN by/IN $/$ 23,625/CD ,/, a/DT firm/JJ limit/NN on/IN loan/NN guarantees/NNS did/VBD provide/VB some/DT consolation/NN in/IN the/DT face/NN of/IN allowing/VBG a/DT haphazard/JJ floating/JJ cap/NN to/TO remain/VB in/IN the/DT bill/NN ./.
an/DT FHA/NNP expansion/NN risky/JJ ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ also/RB a/DT direct/JJ government/NN intrusion/NN into/IN a/DT market/NN already/RB served/VBN by/IN private/JJ mortgage/NN insurers/NNS ./.

people/NNS  who/WP can/MD afford/VB payments/NNS on/IN a/DT $/$ 200,000/CD home/NN should/MD be/VB expected/VBN to/TO put/VB more/JJR money/NN down/RP ./.
It/PRP would/MD be/VB difficult/JJ to/TO explain/VB to/TO average/JJ American/JJ workers/NNS that/IN their/PRP$ tax/NN dollars/NNS were/VBD being/VBG used/VBN to/TO guarantee/VB mortgages/NNS on/IN $/$ 200,000/CD homes/NNS ./.
an/DT FHA/NNP expansion/NN is/VBZ such/JJ a/DT great/JJ idea/NN ,/, why/WRB not/RB have/VB the/DT federal/JJ government/NN guarantee/VB all/DT home/NN mortgages/NNS ?/. Congress/NNP can/MD not/RB expect/VB taxpayers/NNS to/TO continue/VB bearing/VBG the/DT burden/NN of/IN well-intended/JJ government/NN guarantees/NNS ./.
Congress/NNP increased/VBD federal/JJ deposit/NN insurance/NN to/TO $/$ 100,000/CD from/IN $/$ 40,000/CD ,/, it/PRP seemed/VBD like/IN a/DT good/JJ idea/NN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD easy/JJ to/TO extend/VB a/DT government/NN guarantee/NN to/TO cover/VB apparent/JJ problems/NNS ./.
