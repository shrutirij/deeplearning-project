Wall/NNP Street/NNP 's/POS takeover-stock/NN speculators/NNS yesterday/NN suffered/VBD their/PRP$ worst/JJS bloodbath/NN since/IN the/DT Black/NNP Monday/NNP crash/NN of/IN October/NNP 1987/CD ./.
the/DT stock/NN market/NN rebounded/VBD from/IN Friday/NNP 's/POS 190.58-point/JJ rout/NN ,/, takeover/NN traders/NNS were/VBD hammered/VBN by/IN setbacks/NNS in/IN two/CD big/JJ airline/NN takeover/NN deals/NNS ./.
Some/DT analysts/NNS estimated/VBD that/IN paper/NN losses/NNS could/MD total/VB $/$ 500/CD million/CD for/IN the/DT takeover/NN traders/NNS ,/, known/VBN as/IN risk/NN arbitragers/NNS ,/, or/CC ``/`` arbs/NNS ./.
all/DT of/IN the/DT big/JJ paper/NN losses/NNS were/VBD caused/VBN by/IN declines/NNS of/IN more/JJR than/IN 20/CD %/NN in/IN two/CD airline/NN stocks/NNS ,/, UAL/NNP Corp./NNP and/CC AMR/NNP Corp/NNP ./.
Wall/NNP Street/NNP 's/POS arbitrage/NN desks/NNS had/VBD loaded/VBN up/RB on/IN stocks/NNS of/IN both/DT  companies/NNS after/IN each/DT had/VBD received/VBN takeover/NN proposals/NNS from/IN investors/NNS ./.
The/DT bid/NN for/IN UAL/NNP came/VBD from/IN Marvis/NNP Davis/NNP of/IN Beverly/NNP Hills/NNPS ,/, Calif./NNP ,/, and/CC the/DT bid/NN for/IN AMR/NNP came/VBD from/IN Donald/NNP Trump/NNP of/IN New/NNP York/NNP ./.
the/DT wake/NN of/IN Friday/NNP 's/POS announcement/NN that/IN a/DT UAL/NNP management-union/NN group/NN could/MD n't/RB obtain/VB bank/NN financing/NN for/IN its/PRP$ agreement/NN to/TO buy/VB UAL/NNP at/IN $/$ 300/CD  a/DT share/NN ,/, UAL/NNP stock/NN plunged/VBD $/$ 56.875/CD yesterday/NN to/TO close/VB at/IN $/$ 222.875/CD  a/DT share/NN in/IN New/NNP York/NNP Stock/NNP Exchange/NNP composite/JJ trading/NN of/IN nearly/RB 2.3/CD million/CD shares/NNS ./.
Friday/NNP ,/, the/DT stock/NN did/VBD n't/RB trade/NN after/IN the/DT buy-out/NN group/NN announced/VBD its/PRP$ financing/NN troubles/NNS ./.
That/DT was/VBD bad/JJ enough/RB for/IN the/DT arbs/NNS ./.

the/DT arbs/NNS were/VBD quickly/RB hit/VBN with/IN another/DT dose/NN of/IN bad/JJ news/NN when/WRB Mr./NNP Trump/NNP announced/VBD that/IN he/PRP was/VBD withdrawing/VBG his/PRP$ proposal/NN to/TO buy/VB AMR/NNP at/IN $/$ 120/CD  a/DT share/NN ./.
AMR/NNP resumed/VBN ,/, the/DT stock/NN fell/VBD sharply/RB to/TO close/VB at/IN $/$ 76.50/CD  a/DT share/NN ,/, down/RB $/$ 22.125/CD on/IN the/DT day/NN in/IN Big/NNP Board/NNP composite/JJ trading/NN of/IN more/JJR than/IN 4.7/CD million/CD shares/NNS ./.
Mr./NNP Gallagher/NNP estimates/VBZ that/IN arbitragers/NNS owned/VBD the/DT equivalent/NN of/IN nearly/RB 30/CD %/NN of/IN UAL/NNP 's/POS stock/NN ,/, or/CC about/IN six/CD million/CD shares/NNS ,/, indicating/VBG losses/NNS of/IN about/IN $/$ 350/CD million/CD ./.
He/PRP estimates/VBZ that/IN arbs/NNS own/VBP the/DT equivalent/NN of/IN about/IN 10/CD %/NN of/IN AMR/NNP 's/POS stock/NN ,/, also/RB about/IN six/CD million/CD shares/NNS ,/, indicating/VBG an/DT additional/JJ $/$ 130/CD million/CD in/IN losses/NNS ./.
Several/JJ other/JJ stocks/NNS owned/VBN by/IN takeover/NN traders/NNS continued/VBD to/TO fall/VB ./.
Many/JJ takeover/NN stocks/NNS rebounded/VBD somewhat/RB yeterday/NN ,/, but/CC none/NN made/VBD up/RP all/DT of/IN their/PRP$ sharp/JJ declines/NNS on/IN Friday/NNP ./.
the/DT losses/NNS ,/, there/EX have/VBP n't/RB been/VBN any/DT reports/NNS of/IN arbitrage/NN or/CC brokerage/NN firms/NNS  that/WDT have/VBP encountered/VBN serious/JJ financial/JJ difficulties/NNS ./.
most/JJS takeover-stock/NN traders/NNS ,/, huge/JJ profits/NNS from/IN booming/JJ takeover/NN activity/NN last/JJ year/NN would/MD provide/VB a/DT cushion/NN against/IN current/JJ losses/NNS ./.
Arbitragers/NNS at/IN several/JJ major/JJ Wall/NNP Street/NNP securities/NNS firms/NNS said/VBD that/IN UAL/NNP was/VBD by/IN far/RB the/DT biggest/JJS stock/NN position/NN that/IN they/PRP owned/VBD ./.
They/PRP also/RB believe/VBP that/IN UAL/NNP was/VBD the/DT biggest/JJS position/NN for/IN most/JJS other/JJ arbs/NNS ./.
the/DT arbitrage/NN community/NN ,/, UAL/NNP was/VBD viewed/VBN as/IN being/VBG a/DT very/RB safe/JJ deal/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD one/CD trader/NN ./.
Arbs/NNS believed/VBD that/IN major/JJ banks/NNS would/MD easily/RB finance/VB the/DT UAL/NNP buy-out/NN group/NN 's/POS $/$ 6.79/CD billion/CD bid/NN ,/, and/CC were/VBD stunned/VBN on/IN Friday/NNP when/WRB the/DT group/NN could/MD n't/RB obtain/VB the/DT necessary/JJ loans/NNS ./.
Several/JJ traders/NNS said/VBD they/PRP were/VBD n't/RB selling/VBG UAL/NNP shares/NNS because/IN they/PRP believe/VBP the/DT buy-out/NN group/NN will/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO obtain/VB financing/NN to/TO complete/VB the/DT acquisition/NN eventually/RB ,/, although/IN perhaps/RB at/IN a/DT price/NN of/IN less/JJR than/IN $/$ 300/CD  a/DT share/NN ./.
Mr./NNP Gallagher/NNP thinks/VBZ that/IN much/JJ of/IN the/DT heavy/JJ trading/NN in/IN UAL/NNP shares/NNS was/VBD ``/`` one/CD arb/NN passing/VBG it/PRP on/RP to/TO another/DT ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB you/PRP have/VBP institutional/JJ investors/NNS buying/VBG the/DT stock/NN ./.
Gainers/NNS among/IN the/DT arb/NN 's/POS favorite/JJ stocks/NNS included/VBD Hilton/NNP Hotels/NNPS Corp./NNP ,/, which/WDT rose/VBD $/$ 9.50/CD  a/DT share/NN to/TO close/VB at/IN $/$ 94.50/CD in/IN Big/NNP Board/NNP composite/JJ trading/NN ,/, and/CC Warner/NNP Communications/NNPS Inc./NNP ,/, which/WDT rose/VBD $/$ 1.875/CD to/TO close/VB at/IN $/$ 63.375/CD ./.
Hilton/NNP is/VBZ soliciting/VBG bids/NNS for/IN some/DT or/CC all/DT of/IN its/PRP$ hotel/NN and/CC casino/NN operations/NNS ;/: Warner/NNP is/VBZ being/VBG acquired/VBN by/IN Time/NN Warner/NNP Inc./NNP ,/, which/WDT already/RB owns/VBZ about/IN 58/CD %/NN of/IN Warner/NNP ./.
The/DT past/JJ two/CD trading/NN days/NNS ,/, while/IN painful/JJ ,/, have/VBP n't/RB been/VBN as/RB disastrous/JJ for/IN the/DT arbs/NNS as/IN the/DT October/NNP 1987/CD market/NN crash/NN because/IN takeover-related/JJ stocks/NNS have/VBP n't/RB dropped/VBN as/RB sharply/RB as/IN they/PRP did/VBD two/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, and/CC traders/NNS are/VBP n't/RB as/RB deeply/RB in/IN debt/NN as/IN they/PRP were/VBD then/RB ./.
Friday/NNP and/CC yesterday/NN ,/, the/DT worst/JJS price/NN declines/NNS among/IN takeover-related/JJ stocks/NNS were/VBD about/IN 20/CD %/NN ,/, with/IN most/JJS takeover/NN stocks/NNS falling/VBG between/IN 5/CD %/NN and/CC 15/CD %/NN ./.
October/NNP 1987/CD ,/, however/RB ,/, stocks/NNS of/IN some/DT potential/JJ takeover/NN targets/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN Dayton/NNP Hudson/NNP Corp./NNP ,/, fell/VBD about/IN 50/CD %/NN ,/, Mr./NNP Gallagher/NNP said/VBD ./.
A/DT trader/NN at/IN one/CD major/JJ Wall/NNP Street/NNP firm/NN said/VBD his/PRP$ arbitrage/NN desk/NN had/VBD about/IN 30/CD %/NN of/IN its/PRP$ capital/NN currently/RB invested/VBN in/IN cash/NN ./.
Two/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, he/PRP said/VBD ,/, his/PRP$ firm/NN had/VBD borrowed/VBN an/DT amount/NN equal/JJ to/TO about/IN 30/CD %/NN of/IN its/PRP$ capital/NN so/IN that/IN it/PRP could/MD buy/VB more/JJR stocks/NNS ./.
Mr./NNP Gallagher/NNP said/VBD he/PRP believes/VBZ that/IN situation/NN is/VBZ typical/JJ of/IN the/DT more/RBR conservative/JJ strategies/NNS that/IN many/JJ arbitragers/NNS adopted/VBN after/IN the/DT crash/NN ./.
traders/NNS borrow/VBP money/NN to/TO buy/VB additional/JJ amounts/NNS of/IN stock/NN ,/, they/PRP run/VBP the/DT risk/NN of/IN having/VBG to/TO sell/VB stocks/NNS after/IN a/DT sharp/JJ price/NN decline/NN such/JJ as/IN yesterday/NN 's/POS to/TO meet/VB margin/NN calls/NNS ./.
Margin/NN calls/NNS are/VBP demands/NNS by/IN lenders/NNS that/IN traders/NNS put/VBN up/RP more/JJR cash/NN to/TO make/VB up/RB for/IN declines/NNS in/IN the/DT value/NN of/IN stocks/NNS  that/WDT serve/VBP as/IN collateral/NN for/IN loans/NNS ./.
One/CD trader/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, said/VBD he/PRP believes/VBZ that/IN most/JJS of/IN the/DT selling/NN in/IN takeover-related/JJ stocks/NNS in/IN the/DT past/JJ two/CD trading/NN days/NNS has/VBZ been/VBN the/DT result/NN of/IN judgments/NNS by/IN traders/NNS that/IN takeover/NN bids/NNS are/VBP less/RBR likely/JJ to/TO be/VB completed/VBN ,/, rather/RB than/IN selling/NN prompted/VBN by/IN margin/NN calls/NNS ./.
