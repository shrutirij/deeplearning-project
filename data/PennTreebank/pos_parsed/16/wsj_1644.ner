The/O first/O 10/O pages/O of/O the/O 76/O -/O page/O Weekly/B-ORG Portfolio/I-ORG Perspective/I-ORG are/O completely/O blank/O ,/O except/O for/O the/O page/O numbers/O ./O
Rather/O than/O printing/O devils/O ,/O Shearson/B-ORG puts/O all/O the/O blame/O on/O the/O unpredictable/O stock/O market/O ./O
The/O plunge/O made/O Shearson/B-ORG 's/O market/O commentary/O instantly/O out/O of/O date/O ./O
In/O fact/O ,/O last/O Friday/O 's/O 190.58/O -/O point/O tumble/O in/O the/O stock/O market/O caught/O many/O people/O and/O businesses/O by/O surprise/O ,/O not/O the/O least/O of/O them/O brokerage/O firms/O such/O as/O Shearson/B-ORG that/O print/O their/O weekly/O market/O commentaries/O on/O Fridays/O for/O dissemination/O the/O following/O week/O ./O
Shearson/O ,/O a/O 62/O %/O -/O owned/O unit/O of/O American/B-ORG Express/I-ORG Co./I-ORG ,/O did/O n't/O have/O enough/O time/O to/O update/O its/O market/O commentary/O so/O ,/O ``/O We/O decided/O to/O kill/O our/O strategy/O pieces/O ,/O ''/O says/O Jack/B-PERSON Rivkin/I-PERSON ,/O the/O head/O of/O Shearson/B-ORG 's/O research/O department/O ./O
The/O first/O thought/O some/O investors/O had/O was/O that/O a/O red/O -/O faced/O Shearson/B-ORG must/O have/O been/O wildly/O bullish/O on/O stocks/O in/O its/O original/O commentary/O ,/O and/O that/O 's/O why/O it/O purged/O its/O pages/O ./O
Investors/O recalled/O that/O Shearson/B-ORG last/O week/O had/O been/O advising/O that/O ``/O the/O market/O is/O still/O exhibiting/O all/O the/O signs/O of/O a/O further/O advance/O ./O ''/O
Many/O other/O brokerage/O firms/O had/O similarly/O bullish/O views/O ./O
But/O Mr./O Rivkin/B-PERSON insists/O that/O the/O 10/O pages/O were/O n't/O pulled/O because/O they/O were/O too/O bullish/O ./O
Instead/O ,/O he/O says/O ,/O ``/O they/O were/O cautious/O ,/O and/O that/O was/O n't/O the/O message/O we/O wanted/O to/O deliver/O ''/O on/O Monday/O ./O
As/O Mr./O Rivkin/B-PERSON explains/O it/O ,/O ``/O We/O were/O raising/O some/O caution/O flags/O about/O rate/O rises/O in/O Europe/B-LOC and/O concerns/O about/O the/O LBO/O market/O ./O
And/O by/O late/O Friday/O afternoon/O ,/O actually/O after/O the/O close/O ,/O we/O decided/O that/O was/O the/O wrong/O tone/O to/O take/O ./O
With/O the/O market/O down/O ,/O we/O wanted/O to/O tell/O people/O to/O put/O their/O orders/O in/O on/O the/O opening/O ./O ''/O
Both/O before/O and/O after/O the/O Friday/O plunge/O ,/O Shearson/B-ORG has/O maintained/O a/O recommended/O portfolio/O weighting/O of/O 65/O %/O stocks/O ,/O 20/O %/O bonds/O and/O 15/O %/O cash/O ./O
