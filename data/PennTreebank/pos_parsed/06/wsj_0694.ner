We/O are/O deeply/O disturbed/O that/O a/O recent/O editorial/O stated/O that/O the/O ``/O Americans/O With/O Disabilities/O Act/O of/O 1989/O ''/O was/O ``/O crafted/O primarily/O by/O Democratic/O Senators/O Kennedy/B-PERSON and/O Harkin/B-PERSON ''/O with/O a/O premise/O ``/O based/O on/O the/O presumption/O that/O most/O Americans/O are/O hostile/O to/O the/O disabled/O .../O ./O ''/O
Perhaps/O even/O more/O offensive/O is/O the/O statement/O ,/O ``/O It/O is/O surprising/O that/O George/B-PERSON Bush/I-PERSON and/O the/O White/B-ORG House/I-ORG inner/O circle/O would/O ally/O themselves/O with/O this/O crabby/O philosophy/O ./O ''/O
This/O legislation/O was/O not/O drafted/O by/O a/O handful/O of/O Democratic/O ``/O do/O -/O gooders/O ./O ''/O
Quite/O the/O contrary/O --/O it/O results/O from/O years/O of/O work/O by/O members/O of/O the/B-ORG National/I-ORG Council/I-ORG on/I-ORG the/I-ORG Handicapped/I-ORG ,/O all/O appointed/O by/O President/O Reagan/B-PERSON ./O
You/O depict/O the/O bill/O as/O something/O Democratic/O leaders/O ``/O hoodwinked/O ''/O the/O administration/O into/O endorsing/O ./O
The/O opposite/O is/O true/O :/O It/O 's/O the/O product/O of/O many/O meetings/O with/O administration/O officials/O ,/O Senate/B-ORG staffers/O ,/O advocates/O ,/O and/O business/O and/O transportation/O officials/O ./O
Many/O congressmen/O are/O citing/O the/O compromise/O on/O the/O ``/O Americans/O With/O Disabilities/O Act/O of/O 1989/O ''/O as/O a/O model/O for/O bipartisan/O deliberations/O ./O
Most/O National/B-ORG Council/I-ORG members/O are/O themselves/O disabled/O or/O are/O parents/O of/O children/O with/O disabilities/O ./O
We/O know/O firsthand/O the/O discrimination/O addressed/O by/O the/O act/O :/O to/O be/O told/O there/O 's/O no/O place/O for/O your/O child/O in/O school/O ;/O to/O spend/O lonely/O hours/O at/O home/O because/O there/O is/O no/O transportation/O for/O someone/O in/O a/O wheelchair/O ;/O to/O be/O denied/O employment/O because/O you/O are/O disabled/O ./O
Your/O editorial/O mockingly/O entitles/O this/O legislation/O the/O ``/O Lawyers/O '/O Employment/O Act/O ./O ''/O
For/O the/O 43/O million/O people/O with/O disabilities/O and/O their/O families/O ,/O this/O legislation/O is/O the/O ``/O Emancipation/O Proclamation/O ./O ''/O
